## Project Description
The LEGO-based Low-cost Autonomous Scientist (LEGOLAS) is a low cost solution to the time consuming nature of physical science research. LEGOLAS combines machine learning and robotics to predict and validate pH corrolations between solutions. There is, however a little to be said about the robot's navigation. Our client aquired a LEGOLAS robot from the University of Maryland
